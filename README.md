# DTechDeals
# I have covered all the given scenarios, there are few improvement which could have be done but due to the nature of the project to be just one page i havent focued on it (e.g lazy loading and routing),
# i have updated the project to Latest Angular 6.0.0 and updated other 3rd party packages to latest as well.
# error handling, localization and I18n is not done as part of the excersize.
# my current work place encourages TDD and i have done TDD and written thousands of Tests. i also know their importance in helping to write maintaniable code with a protection against any future regressions but as i had really limited time to do this excersize my priority was to get a working example with  very few tests for the following two classes deals-grid-filter.service and deals-grid.filter.component.ts. prefereably we tend to write three different types of tests (unitTests, easy to write and fast to run),(integration Tests, little slower than unittests but helps catching bugs on the runtime),(protector Tests, slowest of all but give a automated run and replicates test scenarios covered by QA) to ensure a product with highest quality . if needed i can fully test remaining uncovered areas in this project later.
